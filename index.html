                    <div class="grid-item"><h2>Entrepreneur</h2>
                        <p>My entrepreneurial spirit started at
                        a <strong>young age:</strong> in
                        elementary school selling and trading
                        toys and band instrument repair
                        services with my fellow classmates.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid-item"><h2>Self Taught Coder</h2>
                        <p>I started by building batch scripts
                        to programatically deploy and
                        configure cryptomining workers for
                        mining cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin,
                        Ethereum, Zcash, and BitcoinZ. After
                        getting a temporary job with a medical
                        device manufacturer where I started
                        helping with IT, networking, and
                        managing endpoint devices at medical
                        facilities all over North America I
                        realized I was really good at
                        identifying root causes and finding
                        solutions.</p>
                        <p>I then enrolled in the Google IT
                        Support Technician Certificate
                        program through Coursera which helped
                        push my knowledge, understanding, and
                        drive to pivot to the tech industry
                        even further.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid-item"><h2>Lifelong Learner</h2>
                        <p>Since completing the Google IT
                        Support Technician program I have
                        completed several courses related to
                        coding and cloud systems:</p>
                    
                        <li>Mimo (Lambda School) Python
                        Certificate 7/13/2021
                        <li>FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design
                        Certificate 7/07/2021
                        <li> Google IT Support Technician
                        Certificate 7/13/2021
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid-item"><h2>Technical Sales & Support</h2>
                        <p>While I don't consider myself a
                        "salesman" I do take pride in
                        identifying root causes, creating
                        solutions, and sharing them with
                        people and oftentimes this service
                        has a pricetag attached.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid-item"><h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
                        <p>Several people have recently
                        pointed out to me that I frequently
                        evangelize Cybersecurity and related
                        habits that help keep information
                        secure. I had never thought of it as
                        a career option until now but I do
                        love teaching people about the
                        threat vectors and surfaces they can
                        easily mitigate by simply changing
                        some habits.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid-item"><h2>Design, Build, Host, Manage</h2>
                        <p>I believe in a holistic approach
                        to building software (or just about
                        anything) because building anything
                        on a foundation you aren't 100% sure
                        of can be an expensive and
                        frustrating mistake. I strive to
                        accomplish this by investing time in
                        learning about every layer of the
                        tech stack. Even the boring ones.
